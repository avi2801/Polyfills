//React some useful things

// usually there are two ways to handle the data inside a form and these two ways are the reason we have two types of component
// first one is controlled component and the second one is uncontrolled component

// Controlled Component -> the component which maintain the state or manage the stats of the component using react
// and not the dom are controlled component -> like using useState in the code

// Uncontrolled Component -> the component that don't manage the state using react and use the dom to access and get the value of the
// element are uncontrolled components -> like using useRef


// why one should avoid using the uncontrolled component
// 1. it may not be always sync with React and it's lifecyle
// 2. It makes error handling a bit difficult
// 3. manual updating the DOM in react is not a good practice to follow
// 4. reusabilty is sometime hampered
